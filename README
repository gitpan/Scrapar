NAMES

    Scrapar - Just another web scraping framework

DESCRIPTION

    This module helps you write scrapers in a more clean and efficient way.

    It is mainly divided into 3 parts: Backend, Extractor, and Data Handler.

    - A backend is a module that fetches and calls extractors and
      handles data by calling data handlers.

    - An extractor is a text processing module that extracts
      information from a text string.

    - A data handler takes the extracted information and renders it in
      different ways.

USAGE

    To run the scraper is very easy. You just need to call the main
    scraper with a backend.


    # If you install Scrapar in system directories, you just run scrape.pl

    % scrape.pl -b Backend


    # If you are running in the untarred directory, you just run it
    # from the bin directory

    % ./bin/scrape.pl -b Backend
